# 公开信：请立即终止对许章润教授的非法打压<br>Open Letter: End the Illegal Crackdown on Professor Xu Zhangrun Immediately

您好，

我方近日悉知许章润教授已因他直言不讳的政治批评言论而被贵校非法停职调查。您的行为已经损害了清华大学和中国的学术声誉，也构成了对表达自由这项基本人权的严重侵犯：
《中华人民共和国宪法》第三十五条：“中华人民共和国公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由。”
中国已签署的联合国《世界人权宣言》第十九条：“人人有权享有主张和发表意见的自由；此项权利包括持有主张而不受干涉的自由，和通过任何媒介和不论国界寻求、接受和传递消息和思想的自由。”

因此我方迫切要求清华大学：
终止对许教授的所有非法调查并立即完全恢复其职位；
就此次打压的负面影响向公众和清华学生、教职员工道歉并作出处理；
保障支持言论自由的体制机制和校园文化。

认识到贵校或许不愿保障许教授的基本学术自由，我方已采取更多措施以激励您做出正确的举动：

一、我方已发起两封请愿书，一封中文，一封中英双语，当前分别有803人和79人签名。请您也签名并在网上分享。
第一封请愿书链接（中文，无需VPN）。
第二封请愿书链接（英文，需VPN）。
第二封请愿书链接（GitHub上的中文翻译，无需VPN）。

二、认识到您可能强迫许教授删除他的文章，我方已将其写在以太坊加密货币区块链上。因为区块链技术可供数据存储不受变更，您现已永远无法删除他的文章。且因以太坊区块链在全球各地都无法封锁，中国网民仍可以不受文字狱限制地阅读、分享他的文章。
许教授文集链接，含英文翻译。

三、我方已联系有关人员和机构以提高意识并倡议支持许教授的相关行动：
我方已电邮26位美国参议员，告知贵校的人权侵犯并呼吁他们对本次打压的相关人员以全球马格尼茨基人权问责法进行制裁。他们是：Bob Menendez、Catherine Cortez Masto、Chris Coons、Chris Van Hollen、Chuck Grassley、Cory Gardner、David Perdue、Ed Markey、Elizabeth Warren、James Inhofe、James Lankford、Jeff Merkley、Jerry Moran、John Cornyn、John Kennedy、Kirsten Gillibrand、Lisa Murkowski、Marco Rubio、Mike Rounds、Richard Blumenthal、Ron Wyden、Steve Daines、Tammy Baldwin、Ted Cruz、Tim Kaine和Tom Cotton。
我方即将电邮1036位涉华学者以声援，这些学者来自包括哈佛、耶鲁和纽约大学的多所美国大学。我方也将就许教授的案子电邮19个聚焦中国人权的国际组织。
我方也会继续联络所有认定有帮助的人员和机构。

感谢您的合作。我方希望贵校能做出正确的决定。

Hello,

We’ve recently heard that Prof. Xu Zhangrun was illegally suspended and placed under investigation by your university as a result of his outspoken political criticism. Your action has damaged Tsinghua’s as well as China’s academic reputation worldwide. It has constituted a severe violation of freedom of expression, a basic human right:
Article 35 of Constitution of the People’s Republic of China states that, “Citizens of the People’s Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration.”
Article 19 of the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which China is a member of, states that, “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

We therefore urgently demand Tsinghua University to:
End all unlawful investigations on Prof. Xu and resume his position fully and immediately;
Apologize for and address the harm of this crackdown to the public and Tsinghua’s students, faculty and staff;
Ensure institutional mechanisms and a campus culture supporting free speech.

Recognizing that your school may feel reluctant to protect the basic academic freedom of Prof. Xu, we’ve taken additional measures to motivate you to proceed with correct actions:

First, we’ve started two petitions demanding academic freedom for Prof. Xu, one in Chinese, another one bilingual. At the moment, they’ve respectively gathered 803 and 79 signatures. Please sign them and share them online as well.

Link to petition 2 (English, VPN required).
Link to petition 2 (Chinese translation on GitHub, no VPN required).

Second, recognizing that you may coerce Prof. Xu to delete his articles, we’ve written them on the Ethereum cryptocurrency blockchain. Blockchain technology allows data to be immutably stores, so it’s now forever impossible for you to delete his articles. Because it’s also impossible to block access to the Ethereum blockchain anywhere in the world, people in China can still read and share his articles without censorship.

Third, we’ve contacted relevant individuals and institutions to raise awareness and call for possible further action supporting Prof. Xu:
We’ve emailed 26 US senators to inform them on the human rights violation happening at your school and urged them to sanction individuals at your school involved in the crackdown under the Magnitsky Act. They are: Bob Menendez, Catherine Cortez Masto, Chris Coons, Chris Van Hollen, Chuck Grassley, Cory Gardner, David Perdue, Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren, James Inhofe, James Lankford, Jeff Merkley, Jerry Moran, John Cornyn, John Kennedy, Kirsten Gillibrand, Lisa Murkowski, Marco Rubio, Mike Rounds, Richard Blumenthal, Ron Wyden, Steve Daines, Tammy Baldwin, Ted Cruz, Tim Kaine and Tom Cotton.
We’ll soon email 1,036 China scholars at multiple US universities, including Harvard, Yale and New York University to urge their support. We’ll also email 19 international organizations focused on China’s human rights about Prof. Xu’s case.
We’ll also continue to contact all additional individuals and institutions we deem helpful.

Thank you for your cooperation. We hope that your school can make the right decision.
